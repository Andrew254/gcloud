Getting Started with Compute Engine 
we create virtual machines (VMs) and connect them.Then create connections between the instances.
click  Navigation menu >Compute Engine > VM instances
create
Name, type my-vm-1
For Region and Zone, select the region and zone assigned by Qwiklabs.
For Machine type, accept the default.
For Boot disk select Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch). note click change if the image is not the one shown
For Identity and API access leave at default
For Firewall, click Allow HTTP traffic.
Leave all other default
launch the VM, click Create.
Open Cloud Shell button
display all the zones assighned to you by this <command>
        gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1
        (grep tool is for seaching plain text datasets for lines that march regular expression)
choose onother zone othe than the one quicklab assigned you ie us-central1-b
set default zone using this command =>gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b us-central is our default zone
we need to create onother vm which well call my-vm-2  using this <command>
        gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" 
        --machine-type "n1-standard-1" 
        --image-project "debian-cloud" 
        --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" 
        --subnet "default"
we exit the cloudshell by <command> exit
    we need to connect the two instances
click Navigation > Compute Engine > VM instances
we get two vm instance in two different zones
open a command prompt on the my-vm-2 instance, click SSH
using ping command check wether my-vm-1 can reach my-vm-2 on network using this command
ping my-vm-1
the can reach the <my-vm-1>
control+c to abort the ping
ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1
install the Nginx web server with this <command> 
        sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
Using the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server this <command>
        sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
use arrow keys to move the corsor below h1 add this line "Hi from ANKDREW"
control +o > enter >control +x to exit the nano editor
to convirm webserver is serving our page with this <code>
        curl http://localhost
exit command,
check my-vm-2 can reach webserver on my-vm-1 command prompt on my-vm-2 with this command
curl http://my-vm-1
result will be web server to check it out copy the external ip address and copy it on a new tab web browser
