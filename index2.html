Getting Started with Deployment Manager and Cloud Monitoring 
note the value of your GCP project
Navigation menu > APIs & services.
•	Cloud Deployment Manager v2 API
•	Cloud Runtime Configuration API
•	Cloud Monitoring API
these api should be enabled
If one or more APIs is missing, click the Enable APIs and Services button at top. Search the api
Create a Deployment Manager
Open Cloud Shell button 
continue
place the zone into environment variable called MY-ZONE using thsi command
export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a
Download an editable Deployment Manager template using this command
gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/gcpfcoreinfra/mydeploy.yaml mydeploy.yaml
use the sed command to replace the PROJECT_ID placeholder string 
sed -i -e "s/PROJECT_ID/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/" mydeploy.yaml
use the sed command to replace the ZONE placeholder string with your Google Cloud Platform zone using this command:
sed -i -e "s/ZONE/$MY_ZONE/" mydeploy.yaml
6.	View the mydeploy.yaml file, with your modifications, with this command
cat mydeploy.yaml
Now yuor file looks like this
- name: my-vm
    type: compute.v1.instance
    properties:
      zone: us-central1-a
      machineType: zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/n1-standard-1
      metadata:
        items:
        - key: startup-script
          value: "apt-get update"
      disks:
      - deviceName: boot
        type: PERSISTENT
        boot: true
        autoDelete: true
        initializeParams:
          sourceImage: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-v20180806
      networkInterfaces:
      - network: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/qwiklabs-gcp-dcdf854d278b50cd/global/networks/default
        accessConfigs:
        - name: External NAT
          type: ONE_TO_ONE_NAT
Build a deployment from the template
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-first-depl --config mydeploy.yaml
Confirm that the deployment was successful. By clicking Navigation > Compute Engine > VM instances
VM instance called my-vm has been created
Click on the VM instance's name to open
Scroll down to the Custom metadata section and Confirm that the startup script you specified in your deployment manager has been installed
: Update a Deployment Manager deployment
Launch the nano text editor to edit the mydeploy.yaml file with this code
nano mydeploy.yaml
Find the line that sets the value of the startup script, value: "apt-get update", and edit it so that it looks like this:
value: "apt-get update; apt-get install nginx-light -y"
The YAML templating language relies on indented lines as part of its syntax. As you edit the file, be sure that the v in the word value in 
this new line is immediately below the k in the word key on the line above it
control + o then enter then control + x to exit the nano editor then
gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-first-depl --config mydeploy.yaml
this is to update you deployment
Navigation >Compute Engine > VM instances
Go to Custom metadata Confirm that the startup script has been updated to the value you declared in your Deployment Manager template.
View the Load on a VM using Cloud Monitoring
Navigation > Compute Engine > VM instances.
my-vm instance, click SSH 
dd if=/dev/urandom | gzip -9 >> /dev/null & this command is to create CPU Load
Create a Monitoring workspace
Navigation menu > Monitoring
click setting to convirm the GCP project  is shiwn under the GCP project
click setting > agent 
install both the Monitoring and Logging agents on your project's VM.
once through click metrics exproller
In the Metric pane of Metrics Explorer, select the resource type GCE VM instance and the metric CPU usage. 
CPU usage will increase sharply few minutes ago
Terminate your workload generator. 
ssh session on my-vm and enter this command: kill %1
